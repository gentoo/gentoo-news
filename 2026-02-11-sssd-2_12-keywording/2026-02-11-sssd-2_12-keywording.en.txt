sssd now runs as its own user, rather than root, and uses file
capabiltites for its helpers. Although it had this functionalilty for
a while, it wasn't completely usable until 2.10.

sssd-2.12.0 will be the first keyworded version in Gentoo with this
change, made available shortly.

Because of the user change, the sssd database, logs, and
configuration files must have their ownership changed.

== Systemd users ==
After upgrading sssd to >=2.10, stop the sssd service. Then execute the following
commands:

chown -R sssd:sssd /var/lib/sss
chown -R sssd:sssd /var/log/sssd

Then restart the sssd service and verify it launched succesfully.
